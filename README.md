# patchwork

A collection of (hopefully) handy utilities

## Structure

- `applications` -- a set of programs for various purposes written in Java/Python
- `cheatsheets` -- notes, examples and keyboard shortcuts
- `extensions` -- additions that can make life easier
- `scripts` -- utilities written in Bash
- `.editorconfig` -- my customized EditorConfig file
- `.gitignore` -- my customized gitignore file
- `README.md` -- this file

Each directory (sometimes even a subdirectory) has detailed description in its own README file.
